      flexible responsive layout structure without using float or postioning.

       another <div> element and give it to status as flex container.

  <!--How to use flex to aglign div elements side by side:

        <style>
            .mycontainer {
                display: flext;
            }

                width: 33%;
            }
        </style>

<!--Grid

    The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows
    and columns, making it easier to designn web pages without having to use
    floats and positioning.

    Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ablility to define more than one
    row and position each row individually.

    The CSS grid method reqires that you surround the <div> elements with
    another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you
    must specify the width of each column.
